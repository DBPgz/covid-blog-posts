Most importantly, the numbers we have certainly **do not represent the real number of infected individuals**.  That's because many infected individuals are never tested for the virus.  This is especially true for diseases like COVID-19 in which the majority of cases are mild and do not require professional medical care.  Estimates I have seen claim that only about 10-20% of all cases are detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that the fraction of cases that are actually detected is constant over time, then this discrepancy does not hinder our ability to estimate $\\beta$, since multiplying the initial and final number of infected by the same constant will lead to the same estimate of $\\beta$ that would be obtained without that multiplication.  However, it's clear that in many places this factor changes over time as a country starts doing more and more testing.  This would cause the number of reported cases to grow even faster than the real number.  This is most likely occurring, for instance, in the US where previously many individuals with symptoms were not tested due to a lack of test availability.\n",
